# Anucdle
Anucdle is a simple game inspired by popular browser based guessing games such as [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) that merges this functionality with videos taken from [@Anuc7777tawan](https://www.youtube.com/@Anuc7777tawan/videos).  
  
This application uses a python backend to generate the daily clips using GitHub workflows. The frontend is done with very basic Javascript and GitHub pages. Future plans to improve the visuals using React are on the table.
